# RLNET #

RLNET is a lightweight API to help quickly create tile-based games for .NET. RLNET provides a console output, swappable colors, true color sprites, keyboard and mouse inputs.



RLNET uses [OpenTK](http://www.opentk.com)

# Getting Started #

Download the latest version and add a reference to RLNET.dll. Be sure to also reference OpenTK.dll in your project, or get the lastest version on NuGet.

[RLNET Tutorials](https://clarktravism.wordpress.com)


First you must create your root console. This object has access to the window, keyboard, and mouse for your game.
```
RLRootConsole rootConsole = new RLRootConsole("terminal8x8.png", 50, 50, 8, 8, 1f, "RLNET Sample");
```

Then you hook up to its update and render events.

```
rootConsole.Update += rootConsole_Update;
rootConsole.Render += rootConsole_Render;

...

void rootConsole_Update(object sender, UpdateEventArgs e)
{
    //Update Logic Here
}

void rootConsole_Render(object sender, UpdateEventArgs e)
{
    rootConsole.Clear();
    rootConsole.Print(1, 1, "Hello World!", RLColor.White);
    rootConsole.Draw();
}
```

Finally you let it run.
```
rootConsole.Run();
```

Take a look at the RLNET.Sample project to see a working sample.
